# Undefined 3.0
The Universal Binding of Isaac: Rebirth Corruptor.


Is the ordinary Rebirth too... boring for your tastes? Too stale? Too... stable?
Do you lust for chaos in your gameplay? Anarchy? Glitchiness? "isaac-ng.exe has stopped working."?
Search no more as this is precisely the tool you need - the Undefined 3.0! It slices, it dices, it [turns the game into an unspeakable horror full of eldritch abominations](http://prntscr.com/8v303z) and is [user-friendly while at it](http://prntscr.com/8v30e9)!
